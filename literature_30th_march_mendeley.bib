	abstract = {Water flow was visualized around 10 seaweeds with various morphologies to determine the onset of turbulence and to estimate the scales of motion generated by the seaweeds themselves. For single-bladed specimens of the kelps Laminaria setchellii, Costaria costatum, Macrocystis integrifolia, and Alaria marginata, the transition from a laminar to turbulent velocity boundary layer occurred at mainstream velocities of 1.5 cm.s(-1). Transition to turbulence for multiple-bladed specimens of M. integrifolia, Nereocystis luetkeana, Egregia menziesii, and Fucus gardneri occurred at 2.5-3 cm.s(-1) and at 5 cm.s(-1) for the coarsely branched red seaweed, Gelidium coulteri. Flow features such as separation, recirculating eddies, and Von Karman vortex streets were observed around various morphological features. We suggest that in the field, flow around larger macroalgae such as kelp is mostly turbulent and that many seaweeds will lie within the wakes of neighboring macroalgae. For small, branched seaweeds such as G. coulteri, however, the meshlike structure may damp turbulence within the thallus, thereby increasing the mainstream velocity at which the transition to turbulence occurs.},

	abstract = {The effect of submerged flexible vegetation on flow structure (e.g. flow velocity, Reynolds shear stress, turbulence intensity and Manning coefficient) was experimentally studied with a {3D} Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter ({ADV)} in an open-channel flume. The results from flow observations over artificial plants (designed to simulate natural vegetation) showed that flow structure was affected markedly by the presence of submerged flexible vegetation. The study provides understanding of flow patterns, variation in velocity profile and turbulence structures that are affected by plant stem density. The study also reveals how the flow patterns return to stability at the downstream end of the vegetated area which is critical in determining the length of the vegetated areas for restoration cases. Also, new mathematical expressions (equations) have been formulated to clearly express variations in velocity profile, Manning coefficient and flow discharge ratio with vegetation density. Vertically, the velocity profile could be roughly divided into three layers, including the upper non-vegetated layer, the middle canopy layer, and the lower sheath layer. In the upper non-vegetated layer, velocity profiles followed the logarithmic law, and a corresponding empirical equation was developed based on the observed data. The flow is from left to right in this study, and the velocity profile followed a left round bracket "("with the minimum point located at the canopy area ({0.7H(v)}, where H-v denotes vegetation height) within the middle canopy layer. However, the velocity profile followed a right round bracket")" in the lower sheath section layer with the maximum point located at the sheath section ({0.2H(v)).} With increasing vegetation density, the velocity and corresponding flow rate increased in the upper non-vegetated layer and decreased within the middle canopy layer and the lower sheath layer. The ratio of average flow discharge in the non-vegetated and vegetated layers followed the exponential function law with increasing vegetation density. This analysis revealed the effect of vegetation on flood potential and flow bottom scour. Reynolds stresses peaked above the canopy top ({z/H-v} = 1.0-1.2, here z denotes vertical coordinate), and the turbulence intensities reached their maximum peak at two locations including the sheath section ({z/H-v} = 0.1-0.4) and the canopy top ({z/H-v} = 1.0-1.6) for all vegetation densities. Manning coefficient was highly correlated to vegetation density and inflow rate with new empirical equations being proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

The experiments were conducted in a 12.5 m long and 0.30 m wide flume, using five different freshwater plant species (Ranunculus penicillatus, Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, Glyceria fluitans, and Callitriche stagnalis). Velocity components and drag forces were measured using two acoustic Doppler velocimeters ({ADV)} and a specially designed drag measurement device. Drag fluctuations exerted on the plants appeared to be closely related to the ambient turbulence, especially to large-scale turbulent structures. The enhanced turbulent energy downstream from the plants was associated with wake generation, with its magnitude controlled by plant morphology reconfiguration. Frequency spectra of drag fluctuations reveal a frequency range where they follow a power law that can be parameterized using plant and flow properties. The rescaled spectral functions are shown to match the collected data reasonably well. In addition, drag-velocity cross-correlation analyses enabled the estimation of the location of the resultant drag force, which can be interpreted as an integral measure of plant adaptation to the flow. The results revealed different degrees of adaptation of the plants to flowing water, with Fontinalis and Glyceria showing the best hydrodynamic performances, i.e., lower levels of turbulence and drag generation.},

	abstract = {Sediments have a significant influence on the overlying water, and nutrient release from sediments is an important source for lake eutrophication, particularly in shallow lakes. Sediment resuspension is primarily driven by wind-induced currents. In this research, the correlation between release rate of suspended sediment and flow velocity was studied, and an experiment on hydrodynamic forces was conducted in a rectangle flume using water and sediments collected from three sites in Lake Taihu, a eutrophic lake in China. It was shown that the starting velocities of sediment in Lake Taihu at three different incipient standards gained from the experiment were 15, 30, and 40 cm s(-1) and the release rate of suspended sediment could reach up to 643.4, 5377.1, and 13980.5 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Based on the experiment, a water quantity and quality numerical model of wind-induced current with sediment pollution for Lake Taihu was developed. The model was calibrated and validated by applying it to the study of the water quality of Lake Taihu. The calculated values were generally in good agreement with field observations, which indicated that the developed model could represent the dynamics of sediment resuspension to a certain extent. This study provides a new approach and a practical tool for planning and management policy and operations to protect the water quality and ecosystems of shallow lakes.

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that current-driven plant transport in shallow lagoons and estuaries is associated with increased turbidity. Our hypothesis is therefore that macroalgae erode surface sediment while drifting as bedload. This ballistic effect of moving plants on surface sediment was tested in a series of controlled annular flume experiments, where simultaneous measurements of macrophytes transport and turbidity were conducted at increasing current velocities. Sediment erosion always started earlier in experiments with plants than in control experiments without plants. Turbidity increased immediately when plants started to move at current velocities of 2-4 cm s(-1). From a background concentration of 7-10 mg {SPM} l(-1), turbidity increased to 30-50 mg {SPM} l(-1) for Ceramium sp., Ulva lactuca and Chaetomorpha linum, while the more rigid Gracilaria sp., caused much higher turbidities (50-180 mg {SPM} l(-1)). Such plant induced sediment erosion at low current velocity can explain the observed appearance of turbid waters in estuaries and lagoons in the absence of strong wind and wave action. Based on 3-D hydrodynamic modelling, it was determined that plant driven erosion occurs during most of the growth season in a shallow eutrophic estuary (Odense Fjord, Denmark).},

	abstract = {Within intertidal areas of European Atlantic coasts the distribution of the small seagrass Zostera noltii and the halophyte Spartina anglica can partially overlap, despite numerous bio-mechanical, demographic and ecophysiological differences. Both species are known to be ecosystem engineers that modify their habitat by reducing hydrodynamic energy within their canopies. In this study we investigate the influence of biomechanical (i.e. shoot flexibility) and demographic (i.e. shoot density) characteristics of these intertidal plants on their interaction with unidirectional Currents to (1) understand their differences in ecosystem engineering capacity and (2) identify which physical traits explains these differences. In a flume tank, hydrodynamic variables were measured within transplanted S. anglica and Z noltii meadows, and their corresponding simplified mimics. The results revealed that stiff canopies had a larger potential capacity (relative to flexible ones) to trap sediment, as in these vegetations velocity reduction within the canopy combined with a sufficient volumetric flow rate to provide sediment for settling. Flexible canopies were most efficient at reducing erosion by reconfiguration of their leaves. Shoot density increased the magnitude of these effects when values were moderate. However, the capacity to increase sediment accretion disappeared when the maximum velocity attenuation was reached and the flow of water was relocated on top of the canopy. These habitat modifications may provide ecological benefits for saltmarsh and seagrass species. For saltmarsh plants, the rigid shoots allow lateral expansion of their populations via increased sedimentation. For seagrasses, the dense and flexible shoots typical of temperate intertidal populations provide efficient protection from erosive forces, while at the same time helping to avoid stresses, such as drag forces and high sedimentation rates.},

During the study period (19 May-29 September 2009, sampling interval of two weeks), there was a seasonal development of macrophyte stands, as well as variation in suspended matter and sediment resuspension. The resuspension-inhibiting effect of macrophytes was found as decreasing resuspension values in concordance with the increasing macrophyte density during the growing season. However, measured phosphorus resuspension was highest among emergent macrophytes due to high concentration of phosphorus in sediments. A linear regression model for resuspension in shallow coastal areas was developed with which sediment resuspension rate may be predicted.},

	abstract = {Since the early 1990s in the lagoon of Venice, especially in the central basin, the surface sediment underwent high re-suspension and sedimentation changes and water turbidity increased both because of the disappearance of the macroalgal coverage and the harvesting of the Manila clam Tapes philippinarum Adams and Reeve, which had rapidly colonised the bottom free of macrophytes. Clams are harvested with hydraulic and mechanical dredges which remove and re-suspend surface sediments causing the transport and loss of the finest materials. Sediment transport and re-deposition in the lagoon have been monitored with sediment traps placed onto the bottoms near the Malamocco mouth (st. A), the Lido watershed (st. B) and the mainland (sts. C and D). From 1989-1993 to 1998-1999 sedimentation rates increased significantly at st. A (from 41 to 228 kg {DW} m(-2) year(-1)), st. B (from 65 to 760 kg {DW} m(-2) year(-1)) and st. C (from 140 to 721 kg {DW} m(-2) year(-1)), while at st. D sedimentation rates increased only by ca. 20\%. In parallel sediment grain-size changed with a loss of the finest fraction especially near the mainland. The erosion or sedimentation status, acquired by utilizing sedimentation devices placed onto the bottoms, showed that sts. 13, C, D were affected by sediment losses, while st. A, populated by seagrasses and characterised by seasonal variations which depend on the shoot development, did not show any significant bathymetric change on an annual basis. The highest sediment erosion was recorded at st. D (ca. 3.6 cm year(-1)) whereas a loss of ca. 1.5 and 0.5 cm year(-1) was found at sts. C and B, respectively, which accounted for a mean loss in the central lagoon of ca. 1.2 million tonnes year(-1). Those data agree with the previous indirect estimation of sediment loss which was based on the number of fishing boats operating in the lagoon on an annual basis. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Today, the knowledge on the distribution of marine habitats is very fragmented and temporal changes in such patterns are even less known. In this study we assessed spatial variability and temporal dynamics of benthic habitat types in a relatively turbid northeastern Baltic Sea coastal environment using the space-borne multispectral sensor {QuickBird.} Seven broad habitat classes were defined for the study area representing the most typical habitats of the coastal environment. The studied classes were bare sand, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, hard bottom with ephemeral algae, higher-order plants and/or charophytes on soft bright bottom, dense higher-order plant habitats, and drifting algal mats and deep water ({\textgreater}3m). Two {QuickBird} images acquired over a 3 year interval (2005 to 2008) of Western-Estonian archipelago were processed and change detection analysis applied. Although there was a relatively large scatter in reflectance variability within each habitat type, the analyses allowed a clear differentiation of most habitat types. Exceptions were the lack of statistical differences among deep water, drifting algae, and dense higher-order plant communities, as well as among low density higher-order plant and algal communities. Major changes in the spatial patterns of benthic habitats occurred in hydrodynamically active areas. Differences in water properties caused some confusion in classification and therefore resulted in inaccuracies in maps of change. Thus, the used broad habitat classes represent the limit of the method and the multispectral sensors do not allow finer elements of habitats to be captured.

	abstract = {Water movement in freshwater and marine environments affects submersed macrophytes, which also mediate water movement. The result of this complex interaction also affects sediment dynamics in and around submersed macrophyte beds. This review defines known relationships and identifies areas that need additional research on the complex interactions among submersed macrophytes, water movement, and sediment dynamics. Four areas are addressed: (1) the effects of water movement on macrophytes, (2) the effects of macrophyte stands on water movement, (3) the effects of macrophyte beds on sedimentation within vegetated areas, and (4) the relationship between sediment resuspension and macrophytes. Water movement has a significant effect on macrophyte growth, typically stimulating both abundance and diversity of macrophytes at low to moderate velocities, but reducing growth at higher velocities. In turn, macrophyte beds reduce current velocities both within and adjacent to the beds, resulting in increased sedimentation and reduced turbidity. Reduced turbidity increases light availability to macrophytes, increasing their growth. Additionally, macrophytes affect the distribution, composition and particle size of sediments in both freshwater and marine environments. Therefore, establishment and persistence of macrophytes in both marine and freshwater environments provide important ecosystem services, including: (1) improving water quality; and (2) stabilizing sediments, reducing sediment resuspension, erosion and turbidity.},

The aim of this study was to investigate if lower biomass at sheltered sites compared to sites with intermediate exposure to waves can be caused by competition from epiphyton. Investigations were performed in eutrophic lakes in southern Sweden. Samples of submerged macrophytes and epiphytic algae on the macrophytes were taken along a wave exposure gradient. The amount of epiphyton ({AFDW)} per macrophyte biomass decreased with increased exposure. Biomass of submerged macrophytes, on the other hand, increased with increased exposure until a relatively abrupt disappearance of submerged vegetation occurred at high exposures. Production of epiphytic algae was monitored on artificial substrates from June to September at a sheltered and an exposed site in three lakes. It was higher at sheltered sites compared with exposed sites. We suggest that epiphytic algae may be an important factor in limiting the distribution of submerged macrophytes at sheltered sites in eutrophic lakes.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ecss.2006.05.004},
	abstract = {Plant-flow interactions on the surface of tidal wetlands result in flow characteristics that are profoundly different from non-vegetated flows. Reductions in mean flow velocity and turbulence, especially the vertical components, limit vertical mixing and may impact a wide range of processes including geochemical exchanges at the sediment water interface, larval recruitment and dispersion, and sediment deposition and retention. The goal of this paper is to quantify horizontal and vertical components of velocity, turbulence intensity and total turbulent kinetic energy in Spartina alterniflora canopies in southeastern North Carolina and to relate flow characteristics to particulate transport on the marsh surface. Another aim of this paper is to assess the extent to which the distribution of standing biomass affects mean flow and turbulence by comparing S. alterniflora data to other canopy types and through a series of canopy manipulations which altered canopy height and stem densities. The results of this study indicate that flow velocity, turbulence intensity, and total turbulent kinetic energy ({TKE)} are significantly reduced within the vegetated canopy and that this reduction is inversely related to the amount of biomass present in the water column. Within the canopy, approximately 50\% of the initial mean velocity and {TKE} is reduced within 5 m of the canopy edge. Within the canopy, mean velocity and {TKEhoriz} usually exceeded vertical velocity or {TKEvert} and the vertical components of flow were attenuated more strongly than the horizontal. These results suggest that within the vegetation, turbulence contributes more to lateral advection than to vertical mixing. As a result, total suspended solid concentrations were shown to decrease logarithmically with distance from the canopy edge and to decrease at a faster rate in more densely vegetated regions of the canopy (i.e. lower {TKEvert)} as compared to areas of sparser vegetation (i.e. higher {TKEvert).} (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Sedimentation on the surface of tidal marshes is a process that is controlled by the interactions of a complex set of variables. To adequately describe the patterns of sediment transport and deposition in any particular system requires extensive sampling of biological, physical, sedimentological, and geomorphological parameters. In this study, measurements of sediment deposition, marsh elevation, water level, total suspended solid ({TSS)} loads, overmarsh current speeds, and vegetative cover were used to determine which of these factors control sediment distribution patterns in a small marsh basin in southeastern North Carolina. The results of this study suggest that marsh elevation exerted significant control over deposition but that its effects were largely muted by other processes. Creek hydrology, sediment instability associated with areas of new creek development, plant/flow interactions, and tidal creek {TSS} concentrations also influenced sediment deposition in the study area. Flow patterns, resulting from the interaction between tidal stage and marsh topography, controlled the dispersal of particulate matter across the marsh surface and contributed to significant depositional differences among sampling sites as a function of tidal stage. The results of this study indicate that tidal creek geometry, creek channel position, and tidal stage interact synergistically to control sediment/particulate delivery on the surfaces of tidal wetlands.},

	abstract = {Plant development in unshaded streams is reviewed within the context of a conceptual habitat model. Resource factors (incorporating light, nutrients and temperature) predominantly govern the processes of biomass gain and hydraulic factors (incorporating separate temporal and spatial scales) predominantly govern the processes of biomass loss. It is postulated that differences in hydraulic stability among streams over periods greater than a year govern whether a stream (or site) is dominated by periphyton, bryophytes or macrophytes. Hydraulic stability over periods of less than a year governs the average periphyton biomass. During steady-state, interspate periods the effect of spatial differences in hydraulics varies depending on the stage of plant development. Periphyton and macrophyte colonization is enhanced by low velocities, and growth rate and organic matter accrual can be enhanced by moderate velocities. However, high velocities retard colonization and organic matter accrual. For mature communities, the peak biomass of periphyton and macrophytes can be negatively correlated with velocity. This is in contrast with bryophytes, which are often restricted to areas of high velocity on stable substrata. Hydraulic habitat suitability curves have yet to be developed for plant communities in streams.},

	abstract = {Sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes were measured monthly for 2 yr in Mobile Bay, Alabama, {USA.} Rates of sediment oxygen consumption (0.1 to 1.25 {gO(2)} m(-2) d(-1)), ammonium flux (-22 to 181 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), nitrate flux (-14 to 67 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), phosphate flux (-2 to 20.4 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)), and dissolved silicate flux (-1.5 to 342 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) were moderate to high compared to values for other estuaries. A step-wise regression analysis revealed that dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature in bottom-waters explained much of the variance in fluxes. This is presumably because of their influence on rates of microbial and physico-chemical processes. Organic matter availability was not found to be an important factor in regulating temporal (month to month) variability of fluxes, possibly because frequent resuspension of the sediments in this shallow system rendered indices of sediment organic matter nearly constant with time. However, warm season-averaged sediment nutrient releases were correlated with sediment chlorophyll a. This relationship in Mobile Bay is in strong agreement with similar relationships found in other estuarine systems, and suggests that the availability of labile organic matter ultimately regulates the maximum rate of nutrient release by the sediments. Annually averaged sediment fluxes supplied 36 \% of the nitrogen (N) and 25 \% of the phosphorus (P) required by phytoplankton in Mobile Bay. While this is not particularly high compared to other estuaries, monthly estimates show that the sediments can supply from 0 to 94 \% of the N, and 0 to 83 \% of the P required by phytoplankton. In addition, flux ratios show that N and P are released from sediments at {N:P} ratios that rapidly switch from above (maximum 98) to below (minimum 1.2) that required for phytoplankton growth. This pattern is different from cooler temperate systems, where such switching is seasonally based.},

Water turbidity and concentration of suspended solids ({SS)} were significantly lower within the plant bed compared with the surrounding water area. Despite the higher concentration of inorganic suspendoids, the concentration of chlorophyll a was higher in the open water than within the submerged plant bed, owing to the enhanced nutrient recycling rate in the absence of submerged plants. With the resuspended sediment, 11.8 mg P m(-2) d(-1) was brought into the water column within the stand and 24.5 mg P m(-2) d(-1) outside the stand. Within the macrophyte stand, resuspended particles absorbed phosphorus from the water (indicated by the inverse relationship between {SS} and soluble reactive phosphorus), which was probably connected to the lowered phosphorus concentration of surface sediment due to uptake by macrophytes.

Two major weather-induced disturbances occurred during the study: a long, stormy period during a mild winter and a cold winter with extreme low water levels. The stormy period caused a large loss of species from plots (95 +/- 5\% {SE)} at the most wave-exposed site, resulting in a low species number per plot (0.8 +/- 0.2) the following summer. During the three following years the mean species number increased to 3.6 +/- 0.2. The cold winter caused high species turnover and increased species number per plot at the two most wave-exposed sites. The species turnover at the sheltered site was highest in the two years with low water level in May, possibly due to increased waterfowl herbivory. Annuals, loosely anchored and highly reproductive species had significantly higher plot colonization rates and lower persistence than perennials, well-anchored species and species with none or low reproduction. The extent of lateral growth had no significant effect on colonization or persistence. Although these disturbances have a large effect on the dynamics, species mobility was also high in other years. Relative to other, similar, studies in terrestrial vegetation mean persistence in plots was remarkably low and mean mobility and species turnover rates were very high.},

	abstract = {Variation in settlement and recruitment of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides (L.) was experimentally investigated in the high, mid and low intertidal zones at 2 adjacent sites (A and B) on a rocky shore in Nova Scotia, Canada, following a rare occurrence of ice-scouring. Manipulations in 100 cm2 quadrats at each intertidal height involved removal of various components of the sessile macrofauna and macroflora, removal of the total community and a control treatment. The availability of free space on the substratum in each quadrat was measured prior to the onset of settlement to determine whether differences in the density of barnacles among treatments were due to differences in the availability of free space or to manipulation. Where the density of settlers was high, it was positively related to the availability of free space suggesting that settlement was a simple function of the availability of free space. However, the pattern of settlement varied from the onset to the end of settlement: quadrats from which only barnacles had been removed were occupied early in the settlement period and later-arriving larvae were restricted to less favourable sites where free space was available. Thus, settlement preferences may be masked when the supply of larvae is saturating or the duration of the selction experiment is too long. Where the density of settlers was low and free space was non-limiting, there was no relationship between the density of settlers and the availability of free space. In the high intertidal zone at Site A, the density of settlers was greater in treatments with ephemeral algae (wetter quadrats) than in those without (drier quadrats). In general, early post-settlement mortality in treatments where algae had been removed increased with intertidal height, whereas in treatments where algae were present it remained relatively constant among heights. Post-recruitment mortality did not differ significantly among treatments in the high intertidal zone, suggesting that factors which influence selection of the substratum by cyprid larvae and promote early post-settlement survival may be particularly important in determining subsequent population structure of barnacles in this zone. Post-recruitment mortality, mainly due to predation by whelks, was highest in the low intertidal zone at both sites and did not differ significantly between treatments. In the mid intertidal zone at Site B, whelk foraging appeared to be constrained by desiccation stress and post-recruitment mortality was highest in treatments with Fucus spp. Where predation is intense, initial selection of the substratum by cyprid larvae may have little effect on the subsequent population structure of barnacles.},

Algal biomass and wrack species distribution were characterized, paying special attention to possible relationships between beach slope, tidal height and algal morphology. The results show that the average values in total monthly biomass of stranded macroalgae and seagrasses were similar for both beaches, but certain differences in temporal and spatial variability throughout the year's cycle were detected. Despite this, the distribution of algal species along the beach face was similar in both beaches: large amounts of sheet-like and thin branched species (e.g. Ulva spp., Gracilaria gracilis) dominated the wrack deposits on the low-tide terraces, whereas thick leathery species with positive flotation properties (e.g. Fucus spp., Ascophyllum nodosum) showed larger amounts in the upper foreshore zones. The relative contribution of the major morphological groups of algal wrack shifted throughout the year, suggesting an inverse relation between thick leathery group and sheet-like species, which could be associated with factors such as differences in macroalgae's life cycles and nutrient requirements of fast- and slow-growing species. This study demonstrates that beach topography, together with the morphology of macroalgae species influence the distribution of wrack deposits in estuarine beaches. Further research on the implications of wrack dynamics for sedimentary characteristics and faunal distribution is needed.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that bedload transport of macroalgae in shallow lagoons and estuaries may negatively impact eelgrass through increased turbidity and physical stress. Increased turbidity and reduced benthic light availability for eelgrass occur when bedload transport of macroalgae erode surface sediment. Furthermore, drifting macroalgae ballistically damage eelgrass beds and increase seedling mortality. The frequency and impact of drifting macroalgae in Odense Fjord was evaluated with an agent-based model. The aims of this model were to understand and predict the mobility of opportunistic (Chaetomorpha linum) and non-ephemeral (Fucus vesiculosus) macroalgae and to describe and quantify the intensity and spatial distribution of bottom substrate physically affected by drifting macroalgae. The longest simulated movement by macroalgae was found to be 270 and 170 km for brown and green algae respectively; while the macroalgae losses (export) out of the fjord were up to 11\% of the total biomass; the simulated area impacted by macroalgae drift varied between 16\% and 96.5\% of the total ford area; finally the degree on physically impacted area varied from 0.01 to 28.5 m of algae track m(-2). The simulated pattern of drift distribution and hot spots for both brown and green algae fitted the geographical locations in which the algae community was observed on the field. Such high values for sea bed disturbances will have a major impact on the light availability due to sediment resuspension in bare bottoms and on rooted vegetation due to ballistic impacts in areas affected by algae drift.

	abstract = {The decomposition rates of Phragmites australis and Fucus vesiculosus were experimentally determined in an estuarine system using the leaf-bag technique. The study was conducted in fifteen sites arranged in five areas, extending from freshwater, outside the tidal range, to the marine environment, near the mouth of the estuary. The leaf-bags (5 mm mesh), were set up with 3.0 g of dried substrate, submerged in the experimental sites at day 0 and collected at days 3, 7, 15, 30 and 60, to follow biomass loss. The biomass loss through the leaching phase (day 3) was about 16\% for Phragmites australis and 33\% for Fucus vesiculosus and was independent of salinity for both substrates. The difference in the remaining biomass between the two species increased with time and the decomposition rates differed along the sa inity gradient. For F. vesiculosus, the decomposition rate was highest near the mouth of the estuary, corresponding to the preferential distribution area of the algae, and decreased towards freshwater. For Phragmites australis, the fastest decay was observed in the mid estuary, where Phragmites australis occurs naturally, confirming previous studies. The decomposition rates measured at different time intervals (0 -15, 0-30 and 0-60 days) were always higher for the algae and decreased with time for both species. These results indicate that the use of decomposition rates as a measure of ecosystem integrity or quality status in transitional waters will not be straightforward and must take into account, among others, the test species, the study area positioning along the estuarine gradient, and the time interval for the calculation of the decomposition rate.

Low hydrodynamic activity together with sewage discharges and high primary production in the inner fjord promote the enrichment of present day surface sediments in organic matter and metals in contrast to the outer fjord. However, heavy metal contents in the fjord are typical for the western Baltic Sea, although they are higher than in the preindustrial period.
Although the anthropogenic nutrient load has substantially decreased since the 1970s, sediments from the inner fjord contain more organic material in 2006 than in 1972 resulting from still high levels of primary production supported by internal nutrient loading. Of the heavy metals measured, a decrease in Pb content since the 1970s is distinct, which is explained by the banning on gasoline lead. Taken together, these results suggest that the amelioration of environmental conditions needs time but is indeed related to reduced anthropogenic inputs.},

	abstract = {Rez.: Bodden sind Gewässer einer besonderen Art: Sie waren einst Ostseebuchten, sind aber mittlerweile überwiegend vom Meer abgeschnitten und enthalten schwach salziges Wasser. Die vorpommerschen Bodden, die der Autor (bekannt {z.B.} durch {"Insel} Rügen - Die Kreideküste", {BA} 8/07) hier vorstellt, bilden eine beeindruckende, vielgestaltige Küstenlandschaft und werden als Urlaubsort für Naturfreunde, Wanderer, Wassersportler oder Radfahrer immer beliebter. Beschrieben werden neben der Entstehungsgeschichte der Bodden die Beschaffenheit der Bodden selbst und ihrer Küstenlandschaft, das dortige Leben von Pflanzen, Tier und Mensch und dann die einzelnen Teile der Boddenküste, nämlich die Darss-Zingster-Boddenkette sowie Kubitzer, Greifswalder, westrügensche und nordrügensche Bodden. Der Text ist informativ und angenehm zu lesen. Wirklich gelungen und sehr beeindruckend sind die zahlreichen Fotografien, auf denen die Seele dieser einzigartigen Landschaft wirklich in bemerkenswerter Weise wiedergegeben wird. Deutlich aktueller als {"Boddenküste"} vom gleichen Autor ({ID} 29/96). (2) (Heidi Debschütz)},
